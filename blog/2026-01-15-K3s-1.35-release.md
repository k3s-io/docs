Kubernetes 1.35 has arrived! As we roll out this latest version, it’s the perfect time to reflect on the significant strides the K3s project has made over the last quarter. 🥳

Our focus this release was on stability. We know our users value a platform that remains consistent and reliable year-over-year. From major security milestones to core language upgrades, here is what’s new in the world of K3s.

## Key Features and Improvements ✨

#### Modular Executor Interface & CNI Startup 🏗️
One of the most significant architectural improvements in this release is the refactoring of the **Executor interface**. By making CNI startup a first-class part of this interface, we have removed reliance on "CLI flag hacks" and direct dependencies on networking providers like Flannel or Kube-router. This decoupling makes K3s more modular and significantly easier to integrate into diverse platforms and distributions.

#### Embedded Kine Metrics 📊
Visibility into your database layer just got a lot better. We’ve enabled embedded metrics for **Kine**, allowing you to monitor the performance of your external database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) directly through the K3s metrics endpoint. This is essential for debugging latency at the storage layer before it impacts your workloads.

#### Node Password Controller 🔐
Security and automation take a step forward with the introduction of the **Node Password Controller**. This new internal controller helps manage sensitive credentials more effectively within the cluster, reducing manual overhead and tightening the security posture of your deployments.

#### Security Self-Assessment 🛡️
As part of our commitment to excellence, we have completed a comprehensive **Security Self-Assessment**. This deep dive into our architecture and processes ensures that K3s continues to meet the highest standards for production environments, providing a clear roadmap for how we protect your data.

#### Language Evolution: Go 1.25 🚀
K3s is now built with **Go 1.25**. This brings the latest performance optimizations and security patches to the K3s binary, ensuring that our "default" remains the most efficient way to run Kubernetes.

#### Inclusive Naming Migration 🤝
Words matter. We have officially transitioned our primary branch naming from `master` to `main` and updated internal references to align with **inclusive naming standards**. This ensures our codebase remains welcoming to all developers who wish to contribute.

## Bug Fixes and Notable Changes 🛠️

As always, there were a lot of bug fixes and here are the most impactful:

* **Networking & Dual-Stack Resilience:** We've pushed several fixes to stabilize complex networking setups. This includes corrected IPv6 handling for LoadBalancer addresses, resolving fatal errors in Network Policies (NetPol) when node IPs change, and hardening our Tailscale integration to handle pre-existing configurations more gracefully
* **Reliable HA Cluster Management:** Resolved critical edge-case bugs related to **etcd member promotion**. This ensures that as nodes join or leave a high-availability cluster, the quorum remains stable and the promotion process is seamless
* **Release Pipeline Migration:** We successfully migrated the K3s release pipeline to **GitHub Actions**, increasing transparency and ensuring the continuity of our build process for years to come.
