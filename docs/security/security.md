This section describes the methodology and means of securing a K3s cluster. It's broken into 2 sections. These guides assume k3s is running with embedded etcd.

First the hardening guide provides a list of security best practices to secure a K3s cluster.

* [Hardening Guide](hardening-guide.md)

Second, is the self assessment to validate a hardened cluster. We currently have two different assessments available:

* [CIS 1.23 Benchmark Self-Assessment Guide](self-assessment-1.23.md), older version of the CIS benchmark

* [CIS 1.8 Benchmark Self-Assessment Guide](self-assessment-1.8.md), newer version of the CIS benchmark
