title: Rolling Back K3s
---

You can roll back the K3s Kubernetes version after an upgrade, using a combination of K3s binary downgrade and datastore restoration. Rollback can be performed on clusters of all types, including a single-node SQLite, an external datastore, or an embedded etcd. When rolling back to a previous Kubernetes minor version, you must have a datastore snapshot taken on the Kubernetes minor version you wish to roll back to.

:::warning
If you cannot restore the database, you cannot roll back to a previous minor version.
:::

## Important Considerations

- **Backups:** Before upgrading, ensure you have a valid database or etcd snapshot from your cluster running the older version of K3s. Without a backup, a rollback is impossible.
- **Potential Data Loss:** The `k3s-killall.sh` script forcefully terminates K3s processes and may result in data loss if applications are not properly shut down.
- **Version Specifics:** Always verify K3s and component versions before and after the rollback.

## Rolling Back a K3s Cluster

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='SQLite' default>

To roll back a K3s cluster when using a SQLite database, replace the `.db` file with the copy of the `.db` file you made while backing up your database.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='Embedded etcd'>

To roll back a K3s cluster when using an embedded etcd, follow these steps:

1. If the cluster is running and the Kubernetes API is available, gracefully stop workloads by draining all nodes:

    ```bash
    kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data <NODE-ONE-NAME> <NODE-TWO-NAME> <NODE-THREE-NAME> ...
    ```

1. On each node, stop the K3s service and all running pod processes:

    ```bash
    k3s-killall.sh
    ```

1. On each node, roll back the K3s binary to the previous version, but *do not* start K3s.

    - Clusters with Internet Access:

      - Server nodes:

        ```bash
        curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=vX.Y.Zk3s1 INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="server" INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_START="true" sh -
        ```

      - Agent nodes:

        ```bash
        curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=vX.Y.Zk3s1 INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="agent" INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_START="true" sh -
        ```

    - Air-gapped Clusters:

      - Download the artifacts and run the [install script](../installation/airgap.md#2-install-k3s) locally. Add the environment variable `INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_START="true"` when running the install script to prevent K3s from starting.

1. On the first server node or the node without a `server:` entry in its [K3s config file](../installation/configuration.md), initiate the cluster restore. Refer to the [Snapshot Restore Steps](../cli/etcd-snapshot.md#snapshot-restore-steps) for more information:

    ```bash
    k3s server --cluster-reset --cluster-reset-restore-path=<PATH-TO-SNAPSHOT>
    ```

    :::warning
    This overwrites all data in the etcd datastore. Verify the snapshot's integrity before restoring. Be aware that large snapshots can take a long time to restore.
    :::

1. Start the K3s service on the first server node:

    ```bash
    systemctl start k3s
    ```

1. On the other server nodes, remove the K3s database directory:

    ```bash
    rm -rf /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/db
    ```

1. Start the K3s service on the other server nodes:

    ```bash
    systemctl start k3s
    ```

1. Start the K3s service on all agent nodes:

    ```bash
    systemctl start k3s
    ```

1. Verify the K3s service status with `systemctl status k3s`.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='External Database'>

To roll back a K3s cluster when using an external database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), follow these steps:

1. If the cluster is running and the Kubernetes API is available, gracefully stop workloads by draining all nodes:

    ```bash
    kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data <NODE-ONE-NAME> <NODE-TWO-NAME> <NODE-THREE-NAME> ...
    ```

    :::note

    This process may disrupt running applications.

    :::

1. On each node, stop the K3s service and all running pod processes:

    ```bash
    k3s-killall.sh
    ```

1. Restore a database snapshot taken before upgrading K3s and verify the integrity of the database. For example, if you're using PostgreSQL, run the following command:

    ```bash
    pg_restore -U <DB-USER> -d <DB-NAME> <BACKUP-FILE>
    ```

1. On each node, roll back the K3s binary to the previous version.

    - Clusters with Internet Access:
      - Server nodes:

        ```bash
        curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=vX.Y.Zk3s1 INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="server" sh -
        ```

      - Agent nodes:

        ```bash
        curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=vX.Y.Zk3s1 INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="agent" sh -
        ```

    - Air-gapped Clusters:

      - Download the artifacts and run the [install script](../installation/airgap.md#2-install-k3s) locally. Verify the K3s version after install with `k3s --version` and reapply any custom configurations that were used before the upgrade.

1. Start the K3s service on each node:

    ```bash
    systemctl start k3s
    ```

1. Verify the K3s service status with `systemctl status k3s`.

</Tabs>

## Verification

After the rollback, verify the following:

- K3s version: `k3s --version`
- Kubernetes cluster health: `kubectl get nodes`
- Application functionality.
- Check the K3s logs for errors.
