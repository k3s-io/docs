* Backports for 2023-08 release [(#8129)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8129)
  * K3s's external apiserver listener now declines to add to its certificate any subject names not associated with the kubernetes apiserver service, server nodes, or values of the --tls-san option. This prevents the certificate's SAN list from being filled with unwanted entries.
  * K3s no longer enables the apiserver's `enable-aggregator-routing` flag when the egress proxy is not being used to route connections to in-cluster endpoints.
  * Updated the embedded containerd to v1.7.3+k3s1
  * Updated the embedded runc to v1.1.8
  * Updated the embedded etcd to v3.5.9+k3s1
  * User-provided containerd config templates may now use `{{ template "base" . }}` to include the default K3s template content. This makes it easier to maintain user configuration if the only need is to add additional sections to the file.
  * Bump docker/docker module version to fix issues with cri-dockerd caused by recent releases of golang rejecting invalid host headers sent by the docker client.
  * Updated kine to v0.10.2
* - K3s etcd-snapshot delete fail to delete local file when called with s3 flag [(#8144)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8144)
* - Fix for cluster-reset backup from s3 when etcd snapshots are disabled [(#8170)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8170)
* Fixed the etcd retention to delete orphaned snapshots based on the date [(#8189)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8189)
* Additional backports for 2023-08 release [(#8212)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8212)
  * The version of `helm` used by the bundled helm controller's job image has been updated to v3.12.3
  * Bumped dynamiclistener to address an issue that could cause the apiserver/supervisor listener on 6443 to stop serving requests on etcd-only nodes.
  * The K3s external apiserver/supervisor listener on 6443 now sends a complete certificate chain in the TLS handshake.
* Move flannel to 0.22.2 [(#8222)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8222)
* Update to v1.26.8 [(#8235)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8235)

<!-- v1.26.6+k3s1 -->
This release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.6, and fixes a number of issues.

* Backport version bumps and bugfixes [(#7717)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7717)
  * The bundled metrics-server has been bumped to v0.6.3, and now uses only secure TLS ciphers by default.
  * The `coredns-custom` ConfigMap now allows for `*.override` sections to be included in the `.:53` default server block.
  * The K3s core controllers (supervisor, deploy, and helm) no longer use the admin kubeconfig. This makes it easier to determine from access and audit logs which actions are performed by the system, and which are performed by an administrative user.
  * Bumped klipper-lb image to v0.4.4 to resolve an issue that prevented access to ServiceLB ports from localhost when the Service ExternalTrafficPolicy was set to Local.
  * Make LB image configurable when compiling k3s
  * K3s now allows nodes to join the cluster even if the node password secret cannot be created at the time the node joins. The secret create will be retried in the background. This resolves a potential deadlock created by fail-closed validating webhooks that block secret creation, where the webhook is unavailable until new nodes join the cluster to run the webhook pod.
  * The bundled containerd's aufs/devmapper/zfs snapshotter plugins have been restored. These were unintentionally omitted when moving containerd back into the k3s multicall binary in the previous release.

  * K3s now correctly passes through etcd-args to the temporary etcd that is used to extract cluster bootstrap data when restarting managed etcd nodes.
  * K3s now properly handles errors obtaining the current etcd cluster member list when a new server is joining the managed etcd cluster.
  * The embedded kine version has been bumped to v0.10.1. This replaces the legacy `lib/pq` postgres driver with `pgx`.
  * The bundled CNI plugins have been upgraded to v1.2.0-k3s1. The bandwidth and firewall plugins are now included in the bundle.
  * The embedded Helm controller now supports authenticating to chart repositories via credentials stored in a Secret, as well as passing repo CAs via ConfigMap.
* Bump containerd/runc to v1.7.1-k3s1/v1.1.7 [(#7534)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7534)

* Bump cri-dockerd [(#6797)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6797)
  * The embedded cri-dockerd has been updated to v0.3.1
* Update stable channel to v1.25.6+k3s1 [(#6828)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6828)
* E2E Rancher and Hardened script improvements [(#6778)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6778)

* Allow ServiceLB to honor `ExternalTrafficPolicy=Local` [(#6726)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6726)
  * ServiceLB now honors the Service's ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members.
* Fix cronjob example [(#6707)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6707)
* Bump vagrant boxes to fedora37 [(#6832)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6832)

* Add support for user-provided CA certificates [(#6615)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6615)
  * K3s now functions properly when the cluster CA certificates are signed by an existing root or intermediate CA. You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before K3s starts in the github repo at [contrib/util/certs.sh](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/contrib/util/certs.sh).
* Ignore value conflicts when reencrypting secrets [(#6850)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6850)
* Add `kubeadm` style bootstrap token secret support [(#6663)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6663)
  * K3s now supports `kubeadm` style join tokens. `k3s token create` now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL.
  * K3s agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster.
* Add NATS to the list of supported data stores [(#6876)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6876)

* Fix issue with servicelb startup failure when validating webhooks block creation [(#6911)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6911)
  * The embedded cloud controller manager will no longer attempt to unconditionally re-create its namespace and serviceaccount on startup. This resolves an issue that could cause a deadlocked cluster when fail-closed webhooks are in use.
* Fix access to hostNetwork port on NodeIP when egress-selector-mode=agent [(#6829)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6829)
  * Fixed an issue that would cause the apiserver egress proxy to attempt to use the agent tunnel to connect to service endpoints even in agent or disabled mode.
* Wait for server to become ready before creating token [(#6932)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6932)
* Allow for multiple sets of leader-elected controllers [(#6922)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6922)
  * Fixed an issue where leader-elected controllers for managed etcd did not run on etcd-only nodes
* Update Flannel to v0.21.1 [(#6944)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6944)
* Fix Nightly E2E tests [(#6950)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6950)
* Fix etcd and ca-cert rotate issues [(#6952)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6952)
* Fix ServiceLB dual-stack ingress IP listing [(#6979)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6979)
  * Resolved an issue with ServiceLB that would cause it to advertise node IPv6 addresses, even if the cluster or service was not enabled for dual-stack operation.
* Bump kine to v0.9.9 [(#6974)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6974)
  * The embedded kine version has been bumped to v0.9.9. Compaction log messages are now omitted at `info` level for increased visibility.
* Update to v1.26.2-k3s1 [(#7011)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7011)

### Changes since v1.26.0+k3s2:

* Add jitter to scheduled snapshots and retry harder on conflicts [(#6715)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6715)
  * Scheduled etcd snapshots are now offset by a short random delay of up to several seconds. This should prevent multi-server clusters from executing pathological behavior when attempting to simultaneously update the snapshot list ConfigMap. The snapshot controller will also be more persistent in attempting to update the snapshot list.
