## Bootstrapping a Multi-Node K3s cluster via Ansible

For users seeking to bootstrap a multi-node K3s cluster, we recommend the use of an Ansible script. This approach simplifies the process of setting up a K3s cluester by automating the installation and configuration of each node.

For this, take a look at [k3s-io/k3s-ansible](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible) repository. These scripts provides a convenient way to install K3s on your nodes, allowing you to focus on the configuration of your cluster rather than the installation process.

This approach is particularly useful for creating a High Availability (HA) Kubernetes cluster, as it can be customized to suit the specific requirements of the cluster.
