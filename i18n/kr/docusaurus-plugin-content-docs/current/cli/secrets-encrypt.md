# k3s secrets-encrypt

K3s supports enabling secrets encryption at rest. For more information, see [Secrets Encryption](../security/secrets-encryption.md).

## Secrets Encryption Tool

:::info Version Gate
Available as of [v1.21.8+k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/tag/v1.21.8%2Bk3s1)
:::

K3s contains a CLI tool `secrets-encrypt`, which enables automatic control over the following:

- Disabling/Enabling secrets encryption
- Adding new encryption keys
- Rotating and deleting encryption keys
- Reencrypting secrets

:::caution
Failure to follow proper procedure for rotating encryption keys can leave your cluster permanently corrupted. Proceed with caution.

### Encryption Key Rotation

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Single-Server" default>

To rotate secrets encryption keys on a single-server cluster:

- Start the K3s server with the flag `--secrets-encryption`

:::note 
Starting K3s without encryption and enabling it at a later time is currently *not* supported.
:::

1. Prepare

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt prepare
    ```

2. Kill and restart the K3s server with same arguments. If running K3s as a service:
    ```bash
    # If using systemd
    systemctl restart k3s
    # If using openrc
    rc-service k3s restart
    ```

3. Rotate

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt rotate
    ```

4. Kill and restart the K3s server with same arguments
5. Reencrypt
    :::info
    K3s will reencrypt ~5 secrets per second.  
    Clusters with large # of secrets can take several minutes to reencrypt.
    ::: 
    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt reencrypt
    ``` 


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="High-Availability" default>

The steps are the same for both embedded DB and external DB clusters.

To rotate secrets encryption keys on HA setups:

:::note Notes

- Starting K3s without encryption and enabling it at a later time is currently *not* supported.
- While not required, it is recommended that you pick one server node from which to run the `secrets-encrypt` commands.

:::

1. Start up all three K3s servers with the `--secrets-encryption` flag. For brevity, the servers will be referred to as S1, S2, S3.

2. Prepare on S1

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt prepare
    ```

3. Kill and restart S1 with same arguments. If running K3s as a service:
    ```bash
    # If using systemd
    systemctl restart k3s
    # If using openrc
    rc-service k3s restart
    ```

4. Once S1 is up, kill and restart the S2 and S3

5. Rotate on S1

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt rotate
    ```

6. Kill and restart S1 with same arguments
7. Once S1 is up, kill and restart the S2 and S3

8. Reencrypt on S1
    :::info
    K3s will reencrypt ~5 secrets per second.  
    Clusters with large # of secrets can take several minutes to reencrypt.
    :::
    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt reencrypt
    ```

9. Kill and restart S1 with same arguments
10. Once S1 is up, kill and restart the S2 and S3

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Secrets Encryption Disable/Enable
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Single-Server" default>

After launching a server with `--secrets-encryption` flag, secrets encryption can be disabled.

To disable secrets encryption on a single-node cluster:

1. Disable

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt disable
    ```

2. Kill and restart the K3s server with same arguments. If running K3s as a service:
    ```bash
    # If using systemd
    systemctl restart k3s
    # If using openrc
    rc-service k3s restart
    ```

3. Reencrypt with flags

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt reencrypt --force --skip
    ```

To re-enable secrets encryption on a single node cluster:

1. Enable

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt enable
    ```

2. Kill and restart the K3s server with same arguments

3. Reencrypt with flags

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt reencrypt --force --skip
    ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="High-Availability" default>

After launching a HA cluster with `--secrets-encryption` flags, secrets encryption can be disabled.

:::note
While not required, it is recommended that you pick one server node from which to run the `secrets-encrypt` commands.
:::

For brevity, the three servers used in this guide will be referred to as S1, S2, S3.

To disable secrets encryption on a HA cluster:

1. Disable on S1

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt disable
    ```

2. Kill and restart S1 with same arguments. If running K3s as a service:
    ```bash
    # If using systemd
    systemctl restart k3s
    # If using openrc
    rc-service k3s restart
    ```

3. Once S1 is up, kill and restart the S2 and S3


4. Reencrypt with flags on S1

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt reencrypt --force --skip
    ```

To re-enable secrets encryption on a HA cluster:

1. Enable on S1

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt enable
    ```

2. Kill and restart S1 with same arguments
3. Once S1 is up, kill and restart the S2 and S3

4. Reencrypt with flags on S1

    ```bash
    k3s secrets-encrypt reencrypt --force --skip
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Secrets Encryption Status
The secrets-encrypt tool includes a `status` command that displays information about the current status of secrets encryption on the node.

An example of the command on a single-server node:  
```bash
$ k3s secrets-encrypt status
Encryption Status: Enabled
Current Rotation Stage: start
Server Encryption Hashes: All hashes match

Active  Key Type  Name
------  --------  ----
 *      AES-CBC   aescbckey

```

Another example on HA cluster, after rotating the keys, but before restarting the servers:  
```bash
$ k3s secrets-encrypt status
Encryption Status: Enabled
Current Rotation Stage: rotate
Server Encryption Hashes: hash does not match between node-1 and node-2

Active  Key Type  Name
------  --------  ----
 *      AES-CBC   aescbckey-2021-12-10T22:54:38Z
        AES-CBC   aescbckey

```

Details on each section are as follows:  

- __Encryption Status__: Displayed whether secrets encryption is disabled or enabled on the node  
- __Current Rotation Stage__: Indicates the current rotation stage on the node.  
  Stages are: `start`, `prepare`, `rotate`, `reencrypt_request`, `reencrypt_active`, `reencrypt_finished`  
- __Server Encryption Hashes__: Useful for HA clusters, this indicates whether all servers are on the same stage with their local files. This can be used to identify whether a restart of servers is required before proceeding to the next stage. In the HA example above, node-1 and node-2 have different hashes, indicating that they currently do not have the same encryption configuration. Restarting the servers will sync up their configuration.
- __Key Table__: Summarizes information about the secrets encryption keys found on the node.  
  * __Active__: The "*" indicates which, if any, of the keys are currently used for secrets encryption. An active key is used by Kubernetes to encrypt any new secrets.
  * __Key Type__: All keys using this tool are `AES-CBC` type. See more info [here.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/#providers)
  * __Name__: Name of the encryption key.
